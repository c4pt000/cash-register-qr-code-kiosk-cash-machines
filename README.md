# register can also act as a bitcoin atm if the store is loaded with funds to disperse to take cash under $10,000

# an infrared scanner can read a mobile phone QR display address for sending from the register to the customers phone
# and the register can display a QR code address for the customer to make a payment

# the register can also provide cash back as Bitcoin back in mBTC amount to the customers phone by scanning the customers phone with a QR code

# and the customer can send using their phone Bitcoin wallet to make a payment to the register by scanning the QR code displayed on the pin pad at the register
