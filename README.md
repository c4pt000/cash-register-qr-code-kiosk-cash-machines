# rethinking how payments could be more universal
# verifone universal app to pay at any verifone device with cryptocurrency app loadable via verifone website verifone kiosk links to phone app...phone app links to verifone website
<p>
verifone website is remote and holds customer login and customer funds are held by the customer as a link to phone cryptocurrency wallet think electrum linked to make payment to.verifone verifone then can send payment to the store vendor accept payment in under 60 minutes because customer is good in under 60 seconds of sending payment to verifone as payment since verifone accepts 1 preconfirm.transaction deeming it valid as paid when 1st confirm takes place on verifones side then verifone sends cryptocurrency payment to vendors store wallet receiving address since store has a business login to register a cryptocurrency receiving wallet address with verifone

customer in store loads verifone application right before purchasing something 
verifone kiosk prompts for payment type customer selects cryptocurrency or crypto for short whichever is more visually aesthetic on verifone pinpad kiosk
verifone then displays a QR code link which the customer imports with the verifone application triggering verifones website to prompt user to enter the one time pin sent to the users phone to confirm user login since verifone website user login is telephone number based and login is based on user receiving one time pin
customer starts.by paying for sales.tax in cash or debit first as calculated by sale amount including sales tax which varies from area to area

confirming the purchase amount (minus sales tax) and exchange amount into crypto as real world funds converted to cryptocurrency exchange rate


then the customer hits a checkmark or an X on the phone app to accept payment with cryptocurrency funds deducted from customers balance (which is either held on verifones website or held on the users phone as a DAO wallet)
and then the receipt is emailed to the customers email already on file saving receipt paper

# forgot to mention as a possible suggestion it's probably a better idea and easier for vendors with sales tax to charge sales tax seperate from receiving crypto using the regular methods of debit or cash methods charging sales tax completely seperate each sale per customer

# by setting the network fee to 0.00001 Bitcoin then a transfer is 0.47 cents at 100,000 dollars a coin it's around $1.00 as a fee to use it at the register with these custom apps they should accept payment with one pre confirmation (is it dangerous from Bitcoin rbf functions?)

# the private key should be obscured on the paper as a reminder of retrieval remotely using the phone number stored in a database in a double encrypted manerism encrypted private key server side matches phone user encrypted side with unlocking "salt" to securely deserialize encrypted string for phone side with sms password pin and confirm of phone 




# protect USER with slot machine and ATM to USE APP TO APP DEPOSIT AND WITHDRAWAL SAVE MONEY ON INFRARED SENSOR TOTALLY



# protect kiosk user in general terms, think wawa, 7-11, casino, pharmacy, etc (by not displaying phone number when customer enters phone number for perks)


# the paper QR code wallet receipt style should print the QR code facing the floor.instead of facing the ceiling when the paper QR code wallet receipt ejects out of the.machine


# to protect the customers paper QR code wallet out of the Bitcoin ATM


# (the bitcoin ATM when at a gas station can credit a pump with payment of cryptocurrency deposit by inter-linking APP to APP from Bitcoin ATM (or Kiosk) Internal APP to Gas Pump Internal APP

# protect Bitcoin ATM users by not displaying their phone number as they are entering it directly into the display

# even slot machines vegas or not, can use an casino based application to deposit and receieve bitcoin to the ATM as game credit, by slot machine unique id (UUID) to the application dispatch where the application also has a unique application (UUID) and user id (UUID) when logged in and confirmed (also could include GPS location of machine and user playing to deposit) only the application allows QR code deposit the slot machine has a QR code to download application (to protect interest of deposit of user)

# can be either or direct Bitcoin deposit or 7-11 app in that regard should only be 7-11 app to prevent deposit misconduct and lies if too many customers are standing there to tamper with a deposit address
and other corporate model stores should use an application to buffer payment at the register to stop deposit misconduct in public
think Target, Walmart all the majors

# register can also act as a bitcoin atm if the store is loaded with funds to disperse to take cash under $10,000

# an infrared scanner can read a mobile phone QR display address for sending from the register to the customers phone
# and the register can display a QR code address for the customer to make a payment

# the register can also provide cash back as Bitcoin back in mBTC amount to the customers phone by scanning the customers phone with a QR code

# and the customer can send using their phone Bitcoin wallet to make a payment to the register by scanning the QR code displayed on the pin pad at the register
